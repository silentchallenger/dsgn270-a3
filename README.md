## Concept and Process

- My design concept was creating something related to racing, especially Formula 1. I created this [concept website](https://silentchallenger.github.io/cpnt260-a3/) for an assingment and wanted to create a logo for it. 
- I thought of few stuff to get inspiration for logo such as car, chequered flag or racing helmet. I decided on helmet because it was easier to create in vector form and it had many variations to work on.
- First, I tried to create logo from front of helmet. After designing a mock up, it didn't look good. (pic of first helmet) So, I tried to change percpective and tried to design it from side look.
- However, during the process of designing, I tried to create shape of helmet with ellipse but it looked like an astronaut helmet. As a result, I decided to draw some part of it with pen and combined with tht ellipse. (pic of first draft)
- After creating the main shape of the helmet, I wanted to add name of the website FRS(Formula Racing Stats) into the logo. To achieve that, I selected a font and subtracted from the helmet.
- As a last touch, I wanted to add 7 stars because I inspired from my favourite driver Lewis Hamilton's helmet who is 7 time champion.
- I created a monochrome, purple and red version of it.
